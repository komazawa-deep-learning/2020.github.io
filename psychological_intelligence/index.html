<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence</a></p>
<!--The word "intelligence" derives from the Latin nouns intelligentia or intellēctus, which in turn stem from the verb intelligere, to comprehend or perceive. In the Middle Ages, the word intellectus became the scholarly technical term for understanding, and a translation for the Greek philosophical term nous. This term, however, was strongly linked to the metaphysical and cosmological theories of teleological scholasticism, including theories of the immortality of the soul, and the concept of the Active Intellect (also known as the Active Intelligence). This entire approach to the study of nature was strongly rejected by the early modern philosophers such as Francis Bacon, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and David Hume, all of whom preferred the word "understanding" (in place of "intellectus" or "intelligence") in their English philosophical works.[1][2] Hobbes for example, in his Latin De Corpore, used "intellectus intelligit", translated in the English version as "the understanding understandeth", as a typical example of a logical absurdity.[3] The term "intelligence" has therefore become less common in English language philosophy, but it has later been taken up (with the scholastic theories which it now implies) in more contemporary psychology.[4]

<li>中世に於いては，霊魂の不滅説と関係</li>

<blockquote>
<p>知能とは，推論，計画，問題解決，抽象的思考，複雑な概念の理解，習得の速さ，経験からの学習などを含む一般的能力であり。単に読書による知識や狭義の学術的技能や試験に合格する技能ではなく，周囲を<strong>把握</strong>し，ものごとを<strong>理解</strong>し，何をすればよいのかを<strong>見つける</strong>ことである。Linda(2006)</p>
</blockquote>
<!--    > A very general mental capability that, among other things, involves the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly and learn from experience. It is not merely book learning, a narrow academic skill, or test-taking smarts. Rather, it reflects a broader and deeper capability for comprehending our surroundings—"catching on," "making sense" of things, or "figuring out" what to do.[7]-->

<blockquote>
<p>人はそれぞれ，複雑な考えを理解し，環境へ効果的に適応し，経験から学び，種々の推論をし，考えることで障害を克服しようとする能力において，異なっている。この個人差は大きいが，一貫しているわけではない。個人の脳力は場合により，領域により，基準により異なる。「知性」を定義する試みはこのような現象を明確化し，体系化するものである。多くの分野で解明されてきたが，重要な問題に対して未だ明確に回答を与えることができず，同意がえられていない。Nisser et. al(2006)</p>
</blockquote>
<!--Individuals differ from one another in their ability to understand complex ideas, to adapt effectively to the environment, to learn from experience, to engage in various forms of reasoning, to overcome obstacles by taking thought. Although these individual differences can be substantial, they are never entirely consistent: A given person's intellectual performance will vary on different occasions, in different domains, as judged by different criteria. Concepts of "intelligence" are attempts to clarify and organize this complex set of phenomena. Although considerable clarity has been achieved in some areas, no such conceptualization has yet answered all the important questions and none commands universal assent.-->

## Operations dimension
1.**Cognition** - The ability to understand, comprehend, discover, and become aware of information.
2. **Memory recording** - The ability to encode information.
3. **Memory retention** - The ability to recall information.
4. **Divergent production** - The ability to generate multiple solutions to a problem; creativity.
5. **Convergent production** - The ability to deduce a single solution to a problem; rule-following or problem-solving.
6. **Evaluation** - The ability to judge whether or not information is accurate, consistent, or valid.

## Content dimension

2. **Symbolic** - Information perceived as symbols or signs that stand for something else, e.g., Arabic numerals, the letters of an alphabet, or musical and scientific notations.
3. **Semantic** - Concerned with verbal meaning and ideas. Generally considered to be abstract in nature.
4. **Behavioral** - Information perceived as acts of people. (This dimension was not fully researched in Guilford's project, remains theoretical, and is generally not included in the final model that he proposed for describing human intelligence.)

## Product dimension
1. **Units** - Single items of knowledge.
2. **Classes** - Sets of units sharing common attributes.
3. **Relations** - Units linked as opposites or in associations, sequences, or analogies.
4. **Systems** - Multiple relations interrelated to comprise structures or networks.

<!--Different components of information processing--></li>
</ul>
<!--
Sternberg associated the workings of the mind with a series of components. These components he labeled -->

<ol>
<li>メタ成分</li>
<li>遂行成分</li>
<li>知識獲得成分</li>
</ol>
<!--
the metacomponents, performance components, and knowledge-acquisition components

1. The **metacomponents** are executive processes used in problem solving and decision making that involve the majority of managing our mind. They tell the mind how to act. Metacomponents are also sometimes referred to as a homunculus. A homunculus is a fictitious or metaphorical "person" inside our head that controls our actions, and which is often seen to invite an infinite regress of homunculi controlling each other.[2]

2. Sternberg's next set of components, **performance** components, are the processes that actually carry out the actions the metacomponents dictate. These are the basic processes that allow us to do tasks, such as perceiving problems in our long-term memory, perceiving relations between objects, and applying relations to another set of terms.[3]

3. The last set of components, **knowledge-acquisition components**, are used in obtaining new information. These components complete tasks that involve selectively choosing relevant information from a mix of information, some of it relevant and some of it irrelevant. These components can also be used to selectively combine the various pieces of information they have gathered. Gifted individuals are proficient in using these components because they are able to learn new information at a greater rate.[3]

Whereas Sternberg explains that the basic information processing components underlying the three parts of his **triarchic theory** are the same, different contexts and different tasks require different kinds of intelligence.[4]
-->

<!--
## Componential – analytical subtheory
<!--Sternberg associated the componential subtheory with analytical giftedness. This is -->

<p><!--
one of three types of giftedness--> 
<!-- that Sternberg recognizes. Analytical giftedness is influential in being able to take apart problems and being able to see solutions not often seen. Unfortunately, individuals with only this type are not as adept at creating unique ideas of their own. This form of giftedness is the type that is tested most often.[3]
--></p>
<!--
## Experiential – creative subtheory
<!--Sternberg's 2nd stage of his theory is his experiential subtheory. This stage deals mainly with how well a task is performed with regard to how familiar it is. Sternberg splits the role of experience into two parts: novelty and automation.-->

<!--
1. A novel situation is one that you have never experienced before. People that are adept at managing a novel situation can take the task and find new ways of solving it that the majority of people would not notice.

2. A process that has been automated has been performed multiple times and can now be done with little or no extra thought. Once a process is automatized, it can be run in parallel with the same or other processes. The problem with novelty and automation is that being skilled in one component does not ensure that you are skilled in the other.

The experiential subtheory also correlates with another one of Sternberg's proposed types of giftedness. Synthetic giftedness is seen in creativity, intuition, and a study of the arts. People with synthetic giftedness are not often seen with the highest IQ's because there are not currently any tests that can sufficiently measure these attributes, but synthetic giftedness is especially useful in creating new ideas to create and solve new problems. Sternberg also associated another one of his students, "Barbara", to the synthetic giftedness. Barbara did not perform as well as Alice on the tests taken to get into school, but was recommended to Yale University based on her exceptional creative and intuitive skills. Barbara was later very valuable in creating new ideas for research.[3]
-->

<!--
## Practical – contextual subtheory
-->

<!-- Sternberg's third subtheory of intelligence, called practical or contextual, "deals with the mental activity involved in attaining fit to context".<!--[1] Through the three processes of adaptation, shaping, and selection, individuals create an ideal fit between themselves and their environment. This type of intelligence is often referred to as "street smarts."

1. **Adaptation** occurs when one makes a change within oneself in order to better adjust to one's surroundings. For example, when the weather changes and temperatures drop, people adapt by wearing extra layers of clothing to remain warm.

2. **Shaping** occurs when one changes their environment to better suit one's needs.  A teacher may invoke the new rule of raising hands to speak to ensure that the lesson is taught with the least possible disruption.

3. The process of **selection** is undertaken when a completely new alternate environment is found to replace the previous, unsatisfying environment to meet the individual's goals.[2] For instance, immigrants leave their lives in their homeland countries where they endure economical and social hardships and go to other countries in search of a better and less strained life.
-->

<!--
The effectiveness with which an individual fits his or her environment and contends with daily situations reflects a degree of intelligence. Sternberg's third type of giftedness, called practical giftedness, involves the ability to apply synthetic and analytic skills to everyday situations. Practically gifted people are superb in their ability to succeed in any setting.[3] An example of this type of giftedness is "Kays". Kays did not have outstanding analytical or synthetic abilities, but he "was highly successful in figuring out what he needed to do in order to succeed in an academic environment. He knew what kind of research was valued, how to get articles into journals, how to impress people at job interviews, and the like".[5] Kays' contextual intelligence allowed him to use these skills to his best advantage.

Sternberg also acknowledges that an individual is not restricted to having excellence in only one of these three intelligences. Many people may possess an integration of all three and have high levels of all three intelligences.

<!--
The _g_ factor (also known as general intelligence, general mental ability or general intelligence factor) is a construct developed in psychometric investigations of cognitive abilities and human intelligence. It is a variable that summarizes positive correlations among different cognitive tasks, reflecting the fact that an individual's performance on one type of cognitive task tends to be comparable to that person's performance on other kinds of cognitive tasks. The _g_ factor typically accounts for 40 to 50 percent of the between-individual performance differences on a given cognitive test, and composite scores ("IQ scores") based on many tests are frequently regarded as estimates of individuals' standing on the _g_ factor.  The terms IQ, general intelligence, general cognitive ability, general mental ability, or simply intelligence are often used interchangeably to refer to this common core shared by cognitive tests. The _g_ factor targets a particular measure of general intelligence.
