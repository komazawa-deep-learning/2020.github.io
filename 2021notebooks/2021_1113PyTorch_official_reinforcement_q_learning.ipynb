        "As the agent observes the current state of the environment and chooses an action, the environment *transitions* to a new state, and also returns a reward that indicates the consequences of the action. \n",
        "In this task, rewards are +1 for every incremental timestep and the environment terminates if the pole falls over too far or the cart moves more then 2.4 units away from center. This means better performing scenarios will run for longer duration, accumulating larger return.\n",

        "The CartPole task is designed so that the inputs to the agent are 4 real values representing the environment state (position, velocity, etc.).\n",
