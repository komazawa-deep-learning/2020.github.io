#### ReLU layer
The **ReLU** (rectified linear unit) layer is another step to our convolution layer. 
You’re applying an activation function onto your feature maps to increase non-linearity in the network. 
This is because images themselves are highly non-linear! 
It removes negative values from an activation map by setting them to zero.

Convolution is a linear operation with things like element wise matrix
multiplication and addition. 
The real-world data we want our CNN to learn will be non-linear. 
We can account for that with an operation like ReLU. 
You can use other operations like tanh or sigmoid. ReLU, however, is a popular choice because it can train the network faster without any major penalty to generalization accuracy.



Want to dig deeper? Try Kaiming He, et al. [Delving Deep into Rectifiers: Surpassing Human-Level Performance on ImageNet Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01852).

If you need a little more info about [the absolute basics of activation functions, you can find that here](https://towardsdatascience.com/simply-deep-learning-an-effortless-introduction-45591a1c4abb)!

#### Pooling

The last thing you want is for your network to look for one specific feature in an exact shade in an exact location. 
That’s useless for a good CNN! 
You want images that are flipped, rotated, squashed, and so on. 
You want lots of pictures of the same thing so that your network can recognize an object (say, a leopard) in all the images. No matter what the size or location. 
No matter what the lighting or the number of spots,or whether that leopard is fast asleep or crushing prey. 
You want **spatial variance**! You want flexibility. 
That’s what pooling is all about.

Pooling progressively reduces the size of the input representation. 
It makes it possible to detect objects in an image no matter where they’re located. 
Pooling helps to reduce the number of required parameters and the amount of computation required. 
It also helps control **overfitting**.

Overfitting can be kind of like when you memorize super specific details before a test without understanding the information. 
When you memorize details, you can do a great job with your flashcards at home.
You’ll fail a real test, though, if you’re presented with new information.

(Another example: if all of the dogs in your training data have spots and dark eyes, your network will believe that for an image to be classified as a dog, it must have spots and dark eyes. 
If you test your data with that same training data, it will do an amazing job of
classifying dogs correctly! But if your outputs are only “dog” and “cat,” and your network is presented with new images containing, say, a Rottweiler and a Husky, it will probably wind up classifying both the Rottweiler and the Husky as cats. You can see the problem!)


Without variance, your network will be useless with images that don’t exactly match the training data. 
**Always, always, always keep your training and testing data separate**! 
If you test with the data you trained on, your network has the information memorized! 
It will do a terrible job when it’s introduced to any new data.

#### Overfitting is not cool.
So for this step, you take the **feature map**, apply a **pooling layer**, and the result is the **pooled feature map**.

The most common example of pooling is **max pooling**. 
In max pooling, the input image is partitioned into a set of areas that don’t overlap. 
The outputs of each area are the maximum value in each area. 
This makes a smaller size with fewer parameters.

Max pooling is all about grabbing the maximum value at each spot in the image. 
This gets rid of 75% of the information that is not the feature. 
By taking the maximum value of the pixels, you’re accounting for distortion. 
If the feature rotates a little to the left or right or whatever, the pooled feature will be the same. You’re reducing the size and parameters. 
This is great because it means that the model won’t overfit on that information.

You could use **average pooling or sum pooling**, but they aren’t common choices. 
Max pooling tends to perform better than both in practice. 
In max pooling, you’re taking the largest pixel value. 
In average pooling, you take the average of all the pixel values at that spot in the image. 
(Actually, there’s a trend now towards using smaller filters or discarding pooling layers entirely. 
This is in response to an aggressive reduction in representation size.)

__Want to look a little more at why you might want to choose max pooling
and why you might prefer a stride of two pixels? Check out Dominik
Scherer et. al, [Evaluation of Pooling Operations in Convolutional
Architectures for Object Recognition](http://ais.uni-bonn.de/papers/icann2010_maxpool.pdf).__

If you go [here](http://scs.ryerson.ca/~aharley/vis/conv/flat.html) you can check out a really interesting 2D visualization of a convolutional layer. 
Draw a number in the box on the left-hand side of the screen and then really go through the output. 
You can see the  convolved and pooled layers as well as the guesses. 
Try hovering over a single pixel so you can see where the filter was applied.


So now we have an input image, an applied convolutional layer, and an applied pooling layer.

Let’s visualize the output of the pooling layer!

We were here:

<img src="https://komazawa-deep-learning.github.io/assets/output3.jpg" style="width:94%">
</center>

The pooling layer takes as input the feature maps pictured above and reduces the dimensionality of those maps. 
It does this by constructing a new, smaller image of only the maximum (brightest) values in a given kernel area.

See how the image has changed size?

Cool, right?

#### Flattening

This is a pretty simple step. You flatten the pooled feature map into a sequential column of numbers (a long vector). 
This allows that information to become the input layer of an artificial neural network for further processing.


#### Fully connected layer
At this step, we add an **artificial neural network** to our convolutional neural network. 
(Not sure about artificial neural networks? [You can learn about them here](https://towardsdatascience.com/simply-deep-learning-an-effortless-introduction-45591a1c4abb)!)



The main purpose of the artificial neural network is to combine our features into more attributes. 
These will predict the classes with greater accuracy. This combines features and attributes that can predict classes better.

At this step, the error is calculated and then backpropagated. 
The weights and feature detectors are adjusted to help optimize the performance of the model. 
Then the process happens again and again and again. 
This is how our network trains on the data! 

How do the output neurons work when there’s more than one?

First, we have to understand what weights to apply to the synapses that connect to the output. 
We want to know which of the previous neurons are important for the output.

If, for example, you have two output classes, one for a cat and one for a dog, a neuron that reads “0” is absolutely uncertain that the feature belongs to a cat. A neuron that reads “1 is absolutely certain that the feature belongs to a cat. 
In the final fully connected layer, the neurons will read values between 0 and 1. 
This signifies different levels of certainty. 
A value of 0.9 would signify a certainty of 90%. 
The cat neurons that are certain when a feature is identified know that the image is a cat. 
They say the mathematical equivalent of, “These are my neurons! I should be triggered!” If this happens many times, the network learns that when certain features fire up, the image is a cat.


Through lots of iterations, the cat neuron learns that when certain features fire up, the image is a cat. 
The dog (for example) neuron learns that when certain other features fire up, the image is a dog. 
The dog neuron learns that for example again, the “big wet nose” neuron and the “floppy ear” neuron contribute with a great deal of certainty to the dog neuron.
It gives greater weight to the “big wet nose” neuron and the “floppy ear” neuron. 
The dog neuron learns to more or less ignore the “whiskers” neuron and the “cat-iris” neuron. 
The cat neuron learns to give greater weight to neurons like “whiskers” and “cat-iris.”
(Okay, there aren’t actually “big wet nose” or “whiskers” neurons. 
But the detected features do have distinctive features of the specific class.)


Once the network has been trained, you can pass in an image and the neural network will be able to determine the image class probability for that image with a great deal of certainty.

The fully connected layer is a traditional Multi-Layer Perceptron. 
It uses a classifier in the output layer. 
The classifier is usually a softmax activation function. 
Fully connected means every neuron in the previous layer connects to every neuron in the next layer. 
What’s the purpose of this layer? To use the features from the output of the previous layer to classify the input image based on the training data.

Once your network is up and running you can see, for example, that you have a 95% probability that your image is a dog and a 5% probability that your image is a cat.


Why do these numbers add up to 1.0? (0.95 + 0.05)

There isn’t anything that says that these two outputs are connected to each other. 
What is it that makes them relate to each other? 
Essentially, they wouldn’t, but they do when we introduce the **softmax function**.
This brings the values between 0 and 1 and makes them add up to 1 (100%). 
(You can read all about this on Wikipedia.) 
The softmax function takes a vector of scores and squashes it to a vector of values between 0 and 1 that add up to 1.

After you apply a softmax function, you can apply the loss function.
Cross entropy often goes hand in hand with softmax. 
We want to minimize the loss function so we can maximize the performance of our
network.

At the beginning of backpropagation, your output values would be tiny.
That’s why you might choose cross entropy loss. 
The gradient would be very low and it would be hard for the neural network to start adjusting in the right direction. 
Using cross entropy helps the network assess even a tiny error and get to the optimal state faster.
