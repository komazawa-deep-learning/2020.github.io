## abstract	
Spectacular progress in the information processing sciences (machine learning, wearable sensors) promises to revolutionize the study of cognitive development. 
Here, we analyse the conditions under which ’reverse engineering’ language development, i.e., building an effective system that mimics infant’s achievement	can contribute to our scientific understanding of early language development. 
We argue that, on the computational side, it is important to move from toy problems to the full complexity of the learning situation, and take as input as faithful reconstructions of the sensory signals available to infants as possible. 
On the data side, accessible but privacy-preserving repositories of home data have to be setup. 
On the psycholinguistic side, specific tests have to be constructed to benchmark humans and machines at different linguistic levels. 
We discuss the feasibility of this approach and present an overview of current results.
